/// This sample shows two important debug facilities, that work using the 
/// 'App-rendered' rendering path.

/// This sample illustrates the importance of correct eye-relief, but allowing you
/// to modify it by pressing keys '1' and '2'.  Eye-relief is the distance of your
/// eye from the Rift lens, and controls the distortion correction which is vital 
/// to correct VR.  Ideally, you will have set the correct eye-relief via the 
/// Oculus config tool, and that value should automatically come through.  However, to 
/// debug, this functionality to adjust this, is available in 'App-rendered' mode. 
/// Note that chromatic aberration correction is tied to distortion, and thus this 
/// parameter, and is an easily recognisable symptom if you have the wrong 
/// eye relief.

/// This sample also shows how to manually adjust the timing of the SDK.  Timing is 
/// very important as the SDK needs to predict exactly when the eye images are on
/// the screen, in order to correctly predict the Rift pose to therefore render 
/// the correct image at that time.  This is only available in the 'App-rendered'
/// version, and the user can press keys '3' to '6' for preset adjustments to the timing.
/// In particular, not the detrimental effects of under- or over- prediction and 
/// learn to recognise such things in your application.  In particular, you may 
/// wish to implement such timing variation in your app, to confirm for yourself
/// that the timing delivered by the SDK is correct (it may not be for all hardware
/// yet, but ultimately will be).
