///!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Not sure this is working quite right, timing seems to be off
///!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - might be someone checked in a bug in OVRLib

/// This sample demonstrates how you can burden your application by rendering the room many times, 
/// such that it starts juddering ordinarily, and then remove that juddering and restore
/// the framerate by pressing '1' and allowing the CPU and GPU to run in parallel. 
/// In practise, for your hardware, first increase the burden until framerate is missed.
/// Then press '1' and see frame-rate restored.  This is because we are relaxing the requirement
/// for the GPU to finish before we go onto the next frame, and instead allow it to 
/// complete in parallel on the next frame.
/// However, this often results in an extra 1 frame of latency, so there is a tradeoff here
/// between allowing a higher quality of graphics to run in a frame, and having the lowest
/// latency possible for the best VR.
