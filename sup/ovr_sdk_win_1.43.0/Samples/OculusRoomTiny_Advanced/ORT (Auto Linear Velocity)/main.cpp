/// This sample shows a possible control method, whereby your positional
/// velocity in the world is proportional to your deviation from a 'centre-point',
/// located 1m in front of the camera.  Its interesting, perhaps the basis for 
/// future research, but also to provide a quick demonstration of such a thing,
/// to save everyone repeating it.
/// Try picking points in the room, and moving to them, to see how intuitive it feels.
