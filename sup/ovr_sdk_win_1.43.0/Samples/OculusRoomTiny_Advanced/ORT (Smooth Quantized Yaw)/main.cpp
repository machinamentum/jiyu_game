/// This sample is a step on from the 'quantized yaw' sample, where we seek
/// to retain the anti-nausea benefits, but with a less jarring and 
/// immersion-breaking effect.  One of the means by which this appears to work,
/// is the short duration of the turn effect, before stopping it, and restarting.
/// Note, this would probably benefit from folding that yaw, into the 
/// timewarp calculation, as seen in other samples.
