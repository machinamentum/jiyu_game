/// This sample shows how to interrogate and interpret the SDK to show
/// the camera cone of the position tracking camera.
/// Note how the wireframe box representing the camera in VR, should
/// appear to be in precisely the same location as the camera in the
/// real world.  If it isn't, then typically its a little forward or
/// back, which is caused by incorrect IPD for the user.
/// In particular, note the offset of the camera cone from the origin,
/// by the amount given by the SDK, and also the orientation of the 
/// camera that is a live, varying quantity, that should be accounted
/// for as displayed in this sample.
/// Also note the way the UVs of texture mapping are done on the cone - its 
/// tempting to do this differently, but beware optical illusions forcing
/// alternate interpretations on your brain, e.g with equally spaced lines.
