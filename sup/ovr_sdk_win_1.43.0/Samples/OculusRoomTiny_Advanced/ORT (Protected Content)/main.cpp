/// In this simple sample, we set the flag for protected content,
/// as our application is initialising its VR swapchain.
/// This then prevents other things like mirroring, capture buffers & APIs,
/// and DVR apps from getting the data (they should get black).
/// Specifically in this sample, the mirror window is thus black,
/// whilst the HMD continues to display the scene as normal.
/// Experiment by setting the value to false, and see the mirror
/// window return. 
/// This works as long as the HMD connected supports HDCP (DK2, CV1 are fine, CrescentBay does not).
