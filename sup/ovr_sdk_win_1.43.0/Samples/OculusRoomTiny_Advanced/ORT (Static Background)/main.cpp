/// This is an initial sample to show a code example of utilising a 'static'
/// background to mitigate, or eliminate motion sickness.   Its not the best example
/// in terms of effectiveness, but shows the method of a general 'static' background,
/// even being able to mix itself at all depths with the moving foreground.
/// Static backgrounds (or foregrounds) work in general by convincing the brain that 
/// the user is not actually moving, and the static component provides the basis for that.
/// This leaves the moving part (if done well) seeming like it is moving around you, and
/// you yourself are reassuringly stationary.  As I say, much better examples to come!
