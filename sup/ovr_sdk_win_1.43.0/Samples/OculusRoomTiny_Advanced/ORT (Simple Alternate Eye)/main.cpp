/// This sample shows a simple process to reduce the processing 
/// burden of your application by just rendering one eye each
/// frame, and using the old image for the other eye, albeit fixed
/// up by timewarp to appear rotationally correct.   Note that there
/// are downsides to this, the animating cube has double images, 
/// close objects, particularly the floor, do not stereoscopically match
/// as you move, your IPD will appear to expand and contract with 
/// sideways movement. And as you manually yaw around with cursors, it is 
/// not smooth.  However, we show how to mitigate this last item,
/// by folding the user's yaw into the timewarp calculation.
/// By default, the effect will be active.
/// Hold '1' to enable the alternate eye effect.
/// Hold '2' to deactivate folding user-yaw into timewarp
