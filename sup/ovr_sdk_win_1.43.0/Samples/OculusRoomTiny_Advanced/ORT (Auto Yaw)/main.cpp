/// This demo shows a simple control method where additional yaw is handled
/// automatically by virtue of your head being turned in the direction
/// of the required yaw.  It is proportional from the centre-point (which is 
/// straight at the camera) so that there are no disconnects, and your brain 
/// can absorb the continuous process intuitively and naturally.
/// As an example, try tracking the animating cube.
