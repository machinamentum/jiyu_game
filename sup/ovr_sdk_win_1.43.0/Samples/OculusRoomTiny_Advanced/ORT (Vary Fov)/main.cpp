/// In this sample, pressing '1' varies the FOV.  This is not intended as a realtime 
/// adjustment, since the distortion meshes need to be recalculated at non-trivial
/// cost.  However, this sample illustrates both how to adjust FOV in the SDK,
/// and also underlines the concept of FOV in VR, which is really all about how 
/// much of the screen is visible, rather than zooming or wideangle as its 
/// traditionally thought of in non-VR applications.
