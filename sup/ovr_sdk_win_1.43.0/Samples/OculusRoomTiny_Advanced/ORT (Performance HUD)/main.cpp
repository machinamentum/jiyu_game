/// Oculus Performance (aka Performance Summary) :
///     
///     App Motion-to-Photon Latency
///         Latency from when the last predictied tracking info is queried by the application using ovr_GetTrackingState()
///         to the point when the middle scanline of the target frame is illuminated on the HMD display.
///         This is the same info presented in "Application Latency Timing" section, presented here as part of the performance summary.
///
///     Performance Headroom
///         The percentage of available PC performance that has not been utilized by the client application and compositor.
///         This is essentially the application CPU & GPU time tracked in the "Application Render Timing" pane section divided by the
///         native frame time (inverse of refresh rate) of the HMD. It is meant to be a simple guide for the user to verify that their
///         PC has enough CPU & GPU performance buffer to avoid dropping frames and leading to unwanted judder. It is important to
///         note that as GPU utilization is pushed closer to 100%, the asynchoronous nature of the compositor will cause
///         the "Application GPU" times to start accounting for that GPU time as the application's GPU work is preempted
///         by the compositor's GPU work.
///
///     Application Frames Dropped
///         This is the same value provided in the "Application Render Timing" pane called "App Missed Submit Count".
///
///     Compositor Frames Dropped
///         This is the same value provided in the "Compositor Render Timing" pane called "Compositor Missed V-Sync Count".
///
///     Left-side graph:    Plots frame rate of the application
///     Right-side graph:   Plots the "Performance headroom %" provided in the same section
///
/// Latency Timing Pane :
///
///     App Tracking to Mid-Photon
///         Latency from when the app called ovr_GetTrackingState() to the point in time when
///         the middle scanline of the target frame is illuminated on the HMD display
///        
///     Timewarp to Mid-Photon
///         Latency from when the last predictied tracking info is queried on the CPU for timewarp execution
///         to the point in time when the middle scanline of the target frame is illuminated on the HMD display
///        
///     Flip to Photon-Start
///         Time difference from the point the back buffer is presented to the HMD to the point the target frame's
///         first scanline is illuminated on the HMD display
///        
///     Left-side graph:    Plots "App to Mid-Photon"
///     Right-side graph:   Plots "Timewarp to Mid-Photon" time
///     
/// Application Render Timing Pane :
///
///     App Missed Submit Count
///         Increments each time the application fails to submit a new set of layers using ovr_SubmitFrame() before the
///         compositor is executed before each V-Sync (Vertical Synchronization).
///        
///     App Frame-rate
///         The rate at which application rendering is able to call ovr_SubmitFrame().
///         It will never go above the native refresh rate of the HMD as the call to ovr_SubmitFrame() will throttle
///         the application's CPU execution as necessary.
///        
///     App Render GPU Time
///         The total GPU time spent on rendering by the client application. This includes the work done by the application
///         after returning from ovr_SubmitFrame() using the mirror texture if applicable. It also includes GPU command-buffer
///         "bubbles" that might be prevalent due to the application's CPU thread not pushing data to the GPU fast enough
///         to keep it occupied. Similarly, if the app pushes the GPU close to full-utilization, then there is a
///         good chance that the app's GPU work in-flight for frame (N+1) will be preempted by the compositor's render work
///         for frame (N). Since the app-GPU timing query operates like a "wall clock timer", this will lead to artificially
///         inflated app-GPU times being reported as they will start to include the compositor-GPU-usage times.
///        
///     App Render CPU Time
///         The time difference from when the application continued execution on CPU after ovr_SubmitFrame() returned
///         subsequent call to ovr_SubmitFrame(). This will show "N/A" if the latency tester is not functioning
///         as expected (e.g. HMD display is sleeping due to prolonged inactivity). This includes IPC call overhead
///         to compositor after ovr_SubmitFrame() is called by client application.
///
///     App Queue Ahead Time
///         The amount of adaptive-queue-ahead the application is granted. Queue Ahead is the amount of CPU time the
///         application is given which will change over time based on the application's work load. The value indicates
///         the point in time when the application's CPU thread is yielded in relation to the previous frame's V-Sync.
///
///     Left-side graph:    Plots "App Frame-rate"
///     Right-side graph:   Plots "App Render GPU Time"
///     
/// Compositor Render Timing Pane :
///
///     Compositor Missed V-Sync Count
///         Increments each time the compositor fails to present a new rendered frame at V-Sync (Vertical Synchronization).
///        
///     Compositor Frame-rate
///         The rate at which final composition is happening. This is independent of the client application rendering rate.
///         Since compositor is always locked to V-Sync, this value will never go above the native HMD refresh rate,
///         but if the compositor fails to finish new frames on time, it can go below HMD the native refresh rate.
///        
///     Compositor GPU Time
///         The amount of time the GPU spends executing the compositor renderer.
///         This includes timewarp and distortion of all the layers submitted by the application. The amount of
///         active layers, their resolution and the requested sampling quality can all affect the GPU times.
///
///     Comp Gpu-End to Present
///         The amount of time between when the GPU completes the compositor rendering to the point in time when
///         that buffer is latched in the swap chain to be scanned out on the HMD.
///
///     Left-side graph:    Plots "Compositor GPU Time"
///     Right-side graph:   Plots "Comp Gpu-End to Present"
///
/// Async SpaceWarp Stats :
///
///     ASW Status
///         Shows the availability and current status of ASW. "Not Available" can be due to the OS and/or GPU type
///         used on the PC. "Available - Not Active" will mean the application is successfully maintaining the 
///         required native refresh rate, so ASW is not activated.
///
///     ASW Active-Toggle Count
///         Tracks the number of times ASW has been activated.
///
///     ASW Presented-Frame Count
///         Tracks the number of frames extrapolated by ASW that were displayed. When ASW is active, since the app
///         is forced to run at half-rate, expect this value to increase by 45 fps on a 90 Hz refresh rate HMD.
///
///     ASW Failed-Frame Count
///         Tracks the number of extrapolated frames ASW needed to display, but failed to prepare the frames in time.
///         This can happen for a multitude of reasons ranging from resource contention on the OS, to exceeding
///         the capabilities of the system. 
///     
///Version Info :
///     
///     OVR SDK Runtime Ver
///         Version of the runtime currently installed on the PC. Every VR application that uses the OVR SDK
///         since 0.5.0 will be using this installed runtime.
///
///     OVR SDK Client DLL Ver
///         The SDK version the client app was compiled against.
