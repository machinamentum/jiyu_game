/// This sample shows how to 'freeze' the images rendered for each eye,
/// and let timewarp fix up the image scene.  This is a recommended piece
/// of functionality to ensure that your timewarp functionality is operating 
/// correctly, being quite a subtle but fundamental effect.
/// Hold the '1' key to freeze timewarp, with no new pose data for the 
/// rendering of the texture - although texture is still updated.
/// Hold '2' to freeze even the update of the texture too.
