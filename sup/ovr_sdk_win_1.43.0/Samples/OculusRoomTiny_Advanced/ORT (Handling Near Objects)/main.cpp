/// This sample shows a method of handling near objects.  
/// In particular, the problem arises that we have positional tracking, and the possibility
/// exists in a lot of games, to move right up to the scenery, such that it appear centimeters
/// or millimetres away, when eye comfort would seem to dictate a minimum distance of 10-20cm.
/// Too close objects are the extreme of mismatch between accomodation of your lens, and 
/// and convergence of your eyes - its unnatural, and not the most comfortable.
/// One method is to simply set the near clip plane appropriately, as the other samples do,
/// but it can be 'counter-immersive' to see graphics clip out. 
/// This method shows an alternative,
/// where you set the clip plane very near, and then use a simple pixel shader change
/// to fade out the detail of the near object to a uniform colour, thus your eye is 
/// considerably less tempted to attempt viewing of the too-close graphics, and there
/// is now a built-in implicit warning that you are too close. 
/// Press '1' to fade to black
/// Press '2' to fade to white
/// Press '3' to fade to skyblue
/// To see the method in effect, go right up to one of the walls, or the various items
/// of furniture, and then loom in positionally for the last distance.
