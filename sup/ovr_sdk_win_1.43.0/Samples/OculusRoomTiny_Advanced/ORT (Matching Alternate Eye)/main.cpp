/// This sample is of the rather more complex version of alternate eye rendering.
/// It still renders only one eye per frame, thus saving the processing, but 
/// now it uses a third eye buffer to hold onto frames, and only present them
/// in both eyes when they are a stereoscopically-matching pair.  This gives
/// the impression of running at half frame-rate, even though rotationally the
/// timewarp fixes things up to rotationally be at full frame rate.   
/// Activate by holding the '1' key.
/// Additionally the user manual yaws are incorporated in the timewarp.  Thus the only artifact
/// remaining is that of the double-image animating object. 
/// Hold the '2' to temporarily disable incorporating user yaw into timewarp.

/// Some of the logic is little unusual, so these notes explain in a little
/// more depth what is happening in the 4 frame cycle.
/// Clock%4=0  Move then Render:eye0, into basic0,   Show extra,  basic1
/// Clock%4=1  (same pos)Render:eye1, into basic1,   Show basic0, basic1,
/// Clock%4=2  Move then Render:eye0, into extra     Show basic0, basic1.
/// Clock%4=3  (same pos)Render:eye1, into basic1    Show extra,  basic1
