/// Another sample showing an interesting control method, this time positionally
/// accelerating your avatar via tilts on the Rift.  Hold SPACEBAR to suspend
/// motion to look around.  This is interesting, because the gravity component
/// of your head tilts suggests to your brain that this is a genuine motion, 
/// and thus mitigates motion sickness.
/// Try loosely following the animating cube with your positional movements.
