/// This sample shows the built in debug HUD, with two modes.

/// The first mode, enabled by pressing '1', shows a centred-
/// crosshairs at infinity.  This is very useful particularly 
/// for confirming that 3D objects within the scene are offset
/// left and right for each eye - and not accidentally the same
/// which would yield a monoscopic view.  Also, to see that
/// the amount of offset for objects varies consistently
/// with their distance from the viewpoint.
/// Such offsets are most easily viewed in the mirror window.

/// The second mode, enabled by pressing '2', shows a 3D
/// quad planted in the 3D world.  It provides a very useful 
/// reference point of confirmed 'good-VR', to 
/// compare and refer-to in your scene.  
/// Additionally, the range of the debug quad is given onscreen, 
/// in order for applications to confirm their settings, and 
/// confirm their graphics are also at the correct perceived distance.

/// These can both be scaled, rotated, translated and recolored.
/// Simple examples of how to adjust are given by
/// holding keys '3','4','5' or '6'.
/// Press the '0' key to disable.
