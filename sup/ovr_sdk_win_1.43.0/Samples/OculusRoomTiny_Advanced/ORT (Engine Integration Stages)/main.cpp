/// This sample is a suggested procedure to follow for integrating
/// VR into your engine or application.  Starting from stage 1, which is
/// a non-VR sample application, in a sample engine, you can then follow
/// through the stages, in order, to 6.  At each stage, there are clearly
/// defined goals to achieve in a bite-sized way, so you can build up
/// in a clear, debugable way. 
/// Press ESCAPE to go sequentially from one stage to the next.
/// (Lately, it seems you have to press it pretty promptly, or the code doesn't
/// run once you reach stage 4)
/// The code is laid out as #defines, rather than functions, to avoid
/// the additional overhead of passing variables around which might
/// clutter the code, in order that you can most clearly see the code
/// added at each stage.
