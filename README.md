# jiyu_game
Game programming stuff being written in an experimental programming language. See [jiyu](https://github.com/machinamentum/jiyu).

## Build
```
jiyu build.jyu
```

A first-time build may require that some support libraries be compiled. The build.jyu program can do this automatically by calling:
```
jiyu build.jyu-- build_libs
```
